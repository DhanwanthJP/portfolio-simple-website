# portfolio-simple-website

This is my first project after restarting my web development journey.

I built a simple portfolio website using only HTML and CSS.
The project has two pages:

Home Page – Basic introduction about me

Contact Page – Simple contact information

The main purpose of this project was to practice HTML structure and CSS styling, and to strengthen my fundamentals in web development.

More improvements and projects coming soon 🚀
